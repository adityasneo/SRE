A postmortem is a written record of an incident, its impact, the actions taken to mitigate or resolve it, the root cause(s), and the follow-up actions to prevent the incident from recurring

Teams have some internal flexibility, but common postmortem triggers include:
User-visible downtime or degradation beyond a certain threshold
Data loss of any kind
On-call engineer intervention (release rollback, rerouting of traffic, etc.)
A resolution time above some threshold
A monitoring failure (which usually implies manual incident discovery)
