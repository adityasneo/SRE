Risk Tolerance of Services

Identifying the Risk Tolerance of Consumer Services
There are many factors to consider when assessing the risk tolerance of services, such as the following:
What level of availability is required?
Do different types of failures have different effects on the service?
How can we use the service cost to help locate a service on the risk continuum?
What other service metrics are important to take into account?

Target level of availability
The target level of availability for a given Google service usually depends on the function it provides and how the service is positioned in the marketplace. The following list includes issues to consider:

What level of service will the users expect?
Does this service tie directly to revenue (either our revenue, or our customersâ€™ revenue)?
Is this a paid service, or is it free?
If there are competitors in the marketplace, what level of service do those competitors provide?
Is this service targeted at consumers, or at enterprises?

Types of failures

Cost
Cost is often the key factor in determining the appropriate availability target for a service. Ads is in a particularly good position to make this trade-off because request successes and failures can be directly translated into revenue gained or lost. In determining the availability target for each service, we ask questions such as:

If we were to build and operate these systems at one more nine of availability, what would our incremental increase in revenue be?
Does this additional revenue offset the cost of reaching that level of reliability?
